Demandez le « Guide officiel de l'automobiliste de publié par le MTO » Driving is a privilege - not a right Introduction Ontario is a road safety leader in Canada and North America. The Ministry of Transportation has introduced a range of measures to maintain this record and to improve the behaviour of all drivers. Most collisions are caused by driver error or behaviours such as following too closely, speeding, failure to yield the right of way, improper turns, running red lights and frequently changing lanes",

Statistics show that new drivers of all ages are far more likely than experienced drivers to be involved in serious or fatal collisions. Provincial campaigns promoting the correct use of seatbelts and child car seats, and informing people about drinking and driving and aggressive driving, are making a difference. Ontario’s Graduated Licensing System (GLS), which lets new drivers gain skills and experience in low-risk environments, is also helping to develop better, safer drivers. This handbook gives new drivers the basic information they need about learning to drive in Ontario: the rules of the road, safe driving practices and how to get a licence to drive a car, van or small truck",

Pedestrians should point or make an indication to drivers that they want to cross before entering the roadway (try making eye contact when possible). Drivers including cyclists must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians in the crossover. Once people have cleared the entire roadway, and no other pedestrians are approaching, you may proceed with caution when it is safe",

The simplest and safest way is to drive around the block, but there may be times when this is not possible. In such cases, a U-turn or a three-point turn may be necessary.

Don't compete with another driver, or retaliate for what you believe to be inconsiderate behaviour. If someone else's driving annoys you, don't try to “educate” the person.

Hard braking and overly aggressive turning or accelerating can cause your vehicle to skid and possibly go out of control. To avoid a skid on a slippery road, drive at a reduced speed and operate the vehicle’s controls in a smooth and constrained manner.
